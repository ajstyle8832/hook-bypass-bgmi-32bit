To hook the sub_95F2E function using your provided structure, we first need to understand the concept of function hooking. Hooking is a technique used to intercept function calls, messages, or events passed between software components. In this context, we want to intercept calls to sub_95F2E and possibly modify its behavior or track its usage.

Given your structure, we'll create a hook for sub_95F2E. The key steps are:

Declare a pointer to the original sub_95F2E function.

Define the hook function hFunction which will replace sub_95F2E.

Inside hFunction, implement any additional logic you want to execute before or after the original function call.

Call the original sub_95F2E function from within hFunction.

Here is how the code would look:

c

// Original function signature
int __fastcall sub_95F2E(int a1, unsigned __int8 *a2, size_t a3);

// Pointer to the original function
int (__fastcall *original_sub_95F2E)(int, unsigned __int8 *, size_t) = sub_95F2E;

// Hook function
int __fastcall h_sub_95F2E(int a1, unsigned __int8 *a2, size_t a3) {
    // Your logic before calling the original function
    // For example, logging, modifying arguments, etc.

    // Call the original function
    int result = original_sub_95F2E(a1, a2, a3);

    // Your logic after calling the original function
    // For example, logging, modifying the result, etc.

    return result;
}

Implementation Notes:

Before the hook is active, you must redirect calls from sub_95F2E to h_sub_95F2E. This can be achieved through various methods depending on your system and environment, such as patching the function address in a function table or using a library designed for hooking.

The hook function (h_sub_95F2E) must match the calling convention, return type, and parameters of the original function (sub_95F2E).

Be cautious with the logic you add. Hooking can introduce hard-to-track bugs and may impact performance.

Ensure that your hook is thread-safe if sub_95F2E is called from multiple threads.
